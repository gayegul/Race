It took me about 2 hours (during office hours) to complete the assignment. My TA Nick and Hannah helped me with my code. My friend also went through my code and showed me how to fine tune it so it looks professional and dry. My aim is to make the rabbit go backwards of 1/4 of his speed when he is very distracted (distraction > 8). Do nothing when 8 > distraction > focus. And move forward when his focus > distraction. My turtle usually progresses pretty much all the time since his focus is 9 and distraction > 8 is a small possibility.
